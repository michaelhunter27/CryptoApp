# CryptoApp

This is a desktop application for encrypting and 
decrypting text.  I made this project for a software 
engineering class.  It is written in Python.  The GUI
uses the python package tkinter which is included in most
installations of Python.

## Autofill Feature
New in version 1.1 is an autofill feature which provides 
an example plaintext and encryption key.  It is designed 
to be used with a random text generator microservice created by my 
classmate [@shindelr](https://github.com/shindelr) and can be found in 
[this repository](https://github.com/shindelr/Random-Text-Generator).
CryptoApp will still work without the microservice running, but
the autofill text will not be randomly generated.
